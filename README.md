## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for telecom companies, as it represents the loss of clients or subscribers. Accurately understanding and predicting churn helps to improve retention strategies, optimize marketing, and increase profitability.

This project includes:
- A detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Processing and cleaning of raw data
- Statistical summaries of key features
- A basis for building churn prediction models

## Dataset

The dataset contains detailed information about telco customers, such as demographics, services signed up for, account information, and whether they have churned.
